# How to Learn to Code

* Programming is ultimately about problem solving. not about programming languages.
* practice is an absolutely essential part of learning to code.
* Don't stop learning once you've completed a tutorial.
* solve cool problem and make cool thing;
* remember that learning to code can be a long and diffcult process. if learing to code feels hard, don't get discouraged! That's complete normal.
* switching back and forth

## How to Improve

### How do I move from a beginning to an intermediate level?

* Making this jump between intro tutorials to complex code can be difficult, and is a normal part of learning to code.
* suggestions
  * switch from passive learning to active learning, start actively researching for ways to teach yourself.
  * constantly be practicing. Programming, fundamentally, is really about applied problem-solving, and the best way to learn how to promblem-solve is to constantly be solving problems, big and small.
  * learn how to decompose problems. work on breaking the problem up(decomposing the problem) into smaller and smaller subproblems, until each individual subproblem seems manageable and doable.

> This, by the way, is a pretty effective strategy for self-teaching! As you practice, you'll get better at seeing how to break down problems, and will expend your pool of knowledge/possible solutions to problems.

## Learn how to be systematic

when coding and debugging your code, never fall into the habit of just "trying" things and hoping they work. Be as systematic and rigorous as possible, and avoid "trial-and-error".

Don't just "do" random shit until you get lucky -- be systematic about it.

## Don't be discouraged by having to debug or goole

Even if you're making no progress on your actual code due to some bug, as long as you're being systematic, you're still practicing your problem-solving skills, albeit in a different way.

## Don't be afarid to ask for help

your question should be well-written

## Try taking a more rigorous intro course

work through exercise and mini-projects

## Where can I find practice exercises and project ideas

## How can I improve my skill to convert tasks/problems into programs(Algorithmic thinking)?

do more practices

## Where can I find examples of good code and projects to study?

keep in mind that stduying existing code is not necessarily the best way to learn programming. Programming, in the end, is about applied problem solving.

## How do I learn topics covered by a typical computer science degree? 

## How do I start and finish a large project?
